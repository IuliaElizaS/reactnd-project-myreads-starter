## MyReads Project

This is a project for Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Schoolarships and has only learning purpose.

In the MyReads project, students have to create a bookshelf app that allows the user to select and categorize books they have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The main page displays three shelves called: Currently Reading, Want to Read and Read, each of which contains a number of books. There is also a search page, where the user can search for a new books and add them to the existing library, on the proper shelf.


## Specification

The provided code is the starter template for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The goal of this template is to save student's time by providing a static example of the CSS and HTML markup that may be used, but without any of the React code that is needed to complete the project. Student's job is to add interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code in this template,  update the code to resolve issues and include functionality.

## How to run the app

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the development server with `npm start`

## Sources

The Starter Template: Udacity;
The Backend Server (src/BooksAPI.js): Udacity;
The placeholder for books without cover image:  https://placeholder.com;


 ## Important
 
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App
